# Phase 2: Orchestration - Kubernetes Basics & Advanced
## Objective:
In Phase 2, you will build upon your containerization knowledge by orchestrating your
application using Kubernetes. The goal is to deploy a scalable and highly available application.
### Tasks:
#### 1. Kubernetes Cluster Setup:
* Set up a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or k3s.
* Deploy your Dockerized web application as a Kubernetes Pod.
#### 2. Basic Kubernetes Resources:
* Create a Deployment and ReplicaSet for managing the application.
*  Expose the application externally using a Kubernetes Service.
*  Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) based on CPU usage.
#### 3. Advanced Kubernetes Concepts:
* Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage configuration.
* Set up Kubernetes CronJobs to automate periodic tasks. 
* Implement Liveness and Readiness Probes for monitoring application health.

#### Deliverables:
* Zip file contains Updated Part 1 and:
* Kubernetes manifests for Deployment, Service, HPA, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and
CronJobs.
* Documentation on setting up the Kubernetes cluster and deploying the
application.
